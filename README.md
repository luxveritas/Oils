#Proposal: Aromatherapy.care
Aromatherapy.care is a web app that will allow users to look up information about various essential oils.
Users can search by oil and find out detailed information about the oil. There will also be a special field where a user can enter an ailment and the app will return oils that are commonly used for that ailment.
The app will also have links to purchase oils.
##Specific Functionality
The landing page will be simple and modeled on the Google search page. It will have a box to enter ailment or oil. The results page will have small blurbs about each of the oils with a link to purchase. If the user clicks the blurb, they will be brought to a full page dedicated to the clicked on oil.
##Data Model
The data will come from information that I gathered, aggregated and synthesized, creating original content. The content will consist of the name of the oil, the ailments it is used for, a picture of the plant, an encyclopedic type article, and a link to purchase the oil. There will be a blog page that is updated daily with a new oil use, hint or recipe. I will then place that information into a database that I created using PostgreSQL. 
##Technical Components
The front end will use the twitter bootstrap framework. Fine-tuning will be done where needed in CSS, HTML and JavaScript. 
The database will be accessed via python utilizing Django. The introductions of the oil articles will be used as a blurb on the results page. Images will be retrieved from free stock photo sites, open source templates or created in Adobe Illustrator. The web app will utilize bootstrap with a specific goal of maximal touchscreen utilization. Python, utilizing Django, will handle the processing of the queries. The links to purchase will either lead to a structured form page, a separate site or a PayPal based ecommerce page.
