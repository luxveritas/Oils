#Proposal: Aromatherapy.care
Aromatherapy.care is a web app that will allow users to look up information about various essential oils.
Users can search by oil and find out detailed information about the oil. There will also be a special field where a user can enter an ailment and the app will return oils that are commonly used for that ailment.
The app will also have links to purchase oils.
##Specific Functionality
The landing page will be simple and modeled on the google search page. It will have a box to enter ailment or oil. The results page will have small blurbs about each of the oils with a link to purchase. If the user clicks the blurb, they will be brought to a full page dedicated to the clicked on oil. There might be a blog page to generate new content.
##Data Model
The data will come from information that I gathered, aggregated and synthesized, creating original content. I will then place that information into a database that I created using PostgreSQL. 
##Technical Components
The front end will use the twitter bootstrap framework. Fine tuning will be done where needed in CSS, HTML and javascript.
The database will be accessed via Django.
Something will be done in python. I’m not sure, because it seems like I could get away with javascript(using jquery) and Django. 
##Schedule
###Week 1 [May 12th – May 19th]:

###Week 3 [May 26th – June 2nd]:

###Week 4 [June 2nd – June 9th]:

##Further Work
I will port the web app to make native android and iOS “apps”.
